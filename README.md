# multiple-lab-usage-analysis
“What gets measured gets managed” The prime work of analysing data is to collect the right data. So our objective is to gather the data from the different lab computers for some period of time and visualizing the different areas of computer usage such as Memory consumption, Data consumption, Login activity, File format used and so on. Here we will be collecting data with respect to each computers of lab and aggregating the result to form a pattern for each lab, finally we will be analysing the activities between the each  lab to find the different usage scenarios
